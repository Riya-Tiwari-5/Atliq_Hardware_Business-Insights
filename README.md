# Atliq_Hardware_Business-Insights


Company Overview:-
AtliQ Hardwares is a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India with a significant market footprint in various international territories.

Current Challenge:-
The executive team has identified a critical gap in the availability of actionable insights required to make swift, informed business decisions. This gap is particularly evident in the handling of ad-hoc data requests, which has resulted in delayed responses and missed opportunities.

Strategic Initiative:-
To address this issue, we propose a structured approach to generate insights from ten key ad-hoc data requests. This will involve:

Data Extraction: Utilizing SQL queries to retrieve pertinent data from our databases.
Data Visualization: Converting the extracted data into clear, actionable visualizations.
Insight Generation: Presenting these visualizations to the top management to inform decision-making.
